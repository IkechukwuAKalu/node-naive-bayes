# Node-Naive-Bayes

This is a Nodejs implementation of the Naive Bayes classifer. This is basically part of my final year project which also includes a real-time messaging app to show the classifier in action.

The algorithm used here is based on a book, "Programming Collective Intelligence" by Toby Segaran.
